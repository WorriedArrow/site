My friends have all been making cool websites around now and sending them to me to fix their objectively terrible CSS.
So I figured that this was a little bit overdue.

But now you're here, reading this, on my site.

Anyway, let's look at how I built this:

## Astro
This site is built with Astro, I think it's based on their blog template. Anyway, it's fairly basic, just with some extra styling cuz I need dark mode.

## Vercel
This site is hosted on Vercel, my fav hosting solution. Idk it's just a clean, simple solution.

## CSS
Surprisingly, I didn't use Tailwind on this. That's mostly because I just stole half the CSS from the template and changed a few variables, but we don't have to talk about that.

Anyway, I think that's it for this post.
See ya next time!
